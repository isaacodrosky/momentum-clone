# Momentum Dashboard Clone

<a href="https://dashboard-extension.netlify.app" target="_blank">Live demo</a>

Momentum dashboard clone is a personal dashboard Chrome extension that replaces the default new Chrome tab with a dashboard that uses four different APIs to display:
 - the current time
 - the local weather
 - a background image
 - a random word and its definition
 - a random Animal Crossing villager

It was created in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
